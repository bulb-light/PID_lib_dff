sentence=Discrete PID controller implementation for Arduino and ESP32 boards.
paragraph=This library provides a discrete PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller implementation designed to be efficient, flexible, and easy to integrate into control systems. It supports dynamic parameter reconfiguration, anti-windup mechanisms, and output clamping. The implementation uses trapezoidal approximation for the integral term and backward-difference approximation for the derivative term.
